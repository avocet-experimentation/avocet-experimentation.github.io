### Feature Flag

A **feature flag** is a tool that allows developers and product teams to enable, disable, or modify features in an application without deploying new code. Feature flags act as a control mechanism to dynamically manage feature availability and behavior, providing a way to test, release, and iterate on features more efficiently.

### Override Rule

An **override rule** determines what value to respond with when a client requests the value of a feature flag. Override rules are environment-specific. Avocet offers two types of such rules: **forced values**, and **experiments**. Forced value rules are straightforward: they apply a constant value to a flag, across all users in an environment. These permit a flag to set a value other than the flagâ€™s base value or the null fallback. Avocet experiments involve assigning a user to a group and then selecting the value currently set for that group on the requested flag.

### Experiment

An **experiment** is a systematic evaluation of the impact of a change or variation in an application to make data-driven decisions. In software, experiments aim to evaluate how changes in features, design, or functionality affect user behavior, system performance, or other key metrics.

### Environment

In Avocet, an **environment** is a distinct deployment context where feature flags can have different behavior than in other environments, as defined by override rules. Environments are typically used to separate different stages of the software development lifecycle or to cater to different operational needs.
