title: The Avocet Advantage
description: This section highlights Avocet's unique approach to software experimentation.

Given that experiments must be designed to meet the needs of the research problem, it should be surprising to learn that many software experimentation platforms focus on A/B tests, with limited or no support for switchback tests. In keeping with popular experimentation platforms, Avocet leverages feature flagging to define treatments, and software instrumentation to measure the effects of treatments. A few things, however, set Avocet apart:

- Experiments can consist of any number of feature flags, groups, treatments per group, dependent variables, and hypotheses (formally defined by two conditions and a statistical inference technique by which to compare them). This permits A/B, switchback, and hybrid designs of arbitrary complexity.
- Avocet integrates with any telemetry pipeline to save flag data to telemetry data and to later fetch that data for experiment analysis. This means developers donâ€™t have to worry about splitting or migrating telemetry data, or modifying their existing infrastructure to add feature flagging and experimentation capabilities.
- Components are provided as Docker images, giving full control over where and how to deploy them. This keeps developers in full control of potentially sensitive telemetry data and allows them to be horizontally scaled as desired.
- A seamless React interface for managing feature flags, experiments, and environments
- The code is fully open-source and provided under the MIT license.
